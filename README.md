# 1. Project Summary
- **Description:** This project is a solution to the Mentor Frontend challenge for creating a social links profile. The goal is to design an attractive and responsive component to display social media links.

- **Objective:** Apply HTML and CSS following best practices, such as accessibility and responsive design.

## 2. Process
- **Planning:** I started by researching the design and used Paint to approximate width and height dimensions. I developed the HTML structure, prioritizing accessibility by minimizing the use of div and focusing on semantic tags. I adopted a mobile-first approach and later adapted the design for larger screen sizes.

- **Development:** I implemented a responsive design using relative units along with media queries to ensure proper adaptation across devices.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the semantic structure of the content, ensuring accessibility.
- **CSS:** For the design and implementation of the responsive layout.

Utilized flexbox for element positioning.
Applied media queries and relative units to enhance the responsive experience.

## 4. Challenges Faced
The biggest challenge was correctly sizing the social links to resemble buttons. This process took time because the initial HTML structure was somewhat incorrect. However, I managed to fix and optimize the structure for a better final result.
